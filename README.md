# KataMorseCodeDecoderTDD
Kata to practice Test Driven Development with a "Morse Code Decoder".
The aim of this kata is to translate from written Morse Code to common text:
  1. A "beep" must be passed to program will be represented with "." 
  2. A "long beep" must be passed to program with "-".
  3. Space between letters must be passed to program with one space.
  4. Space between words must be passed to program with two or more spaces.
  4. The decoder should return the result from the morse codified message in a string.
